This repository demonstrates a race condition in asynchronous data fetching in Swift. The code uses DispatchGroup to wait for multiple network requests. However, if multiple requests fail, only the first error is captured. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle multiple asynchronous operations to prevent data loss and ensure all errors are correctly reported.  The bug and solution are presented in Swift.
